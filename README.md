# candies

A collection of simple programs and scripts that can print some system information to `stdout`.   
Examples for such information would be CPU usage, CPU temperature, volume level and battery level.

These can then be used to gather and/or pipe information to a status bar like Lemonbar.   
Personally, I use these for [`succade`](https://github.com/domsson/succade), a Lemonbar wrapper I wrote.

Check out the subdirectories for more information on each individual _block_ (aka _candy_).
